# Repository Samples

Sample project structures for different coding languages. Organising project files in a sensible way. Attempts toward standardisation.

Python maturing toward standard Java and Cpp project repository structures.

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider how to manage repository structure for multicode base? use case for project with; java, python, cpp, for example,  >
* <todo: don't like this approach. Java - in the first case, see java/org/agw/sgwm, Python - in the second case, see py/org/agw/sgwm, Cpp - in the third case, see cpp/org/agw/sgwm> 
* <todo: consider base project repository structure; Cpp, Java, JS/TS, Python, . src, test, lib, bin, config, . Consider deltas with specific tech as seperate, >
* <todo: Maven, stubb, prioritise!, as used in; enterprise java, OSGi projects, IoT M2M, ... >
* <todo: OSGi, stubb, prioritise? see Maven, >
* <todo: Gradle, stubb?, necessary at this point? >
* <todo: Java, web projects, a seperate strcture is required, >
* <done: JS/TS, web projects, JavaScript/TypeScript, a seperate strcture is required, >
* <todo: Node, any different from standrad JS/TS structure? is it even necessary? >
* <todo: others?, >
* <todo: better comprehensive view of necessary non functionals, >
* <todo: iterate, c/cpp, wip, >

DONE
* <done: Python, applications, first cut, v0.1>
* <done: Java, applications, first cut, v0.1>
* <done: Cpp, applications, first cut, v0.1>
* <done: JS/TS, stubb, applications, JavaScript/TypeScript, vanilla, wip 60%? >
* <done: Maven, stubb, wip, >
* <done: OSGi, stubb, wip, >
