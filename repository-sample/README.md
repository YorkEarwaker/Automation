# Repository Samples

Sample project structures for different coding languages. Organising project files in a sensible way. Attempts toward standardisation.

Python maturing toward standard Java and Cpp project repository structures.

### Status

TODO
* <todo: consider base project repository structure; Cpp, Java, JS/TS, Python, . src, test, lib, bin, config, . Consider deltas with specific tech as seperate, >
* <todo: c/cpp, work in progress, wip, >
* <todo: JavaScript, Jest for Node testing, also vanilla JS? >
* <todo: Maven, >
* <todo: Java, web projects, a seperate strcture for  is required, >
* <todo: Node, any different from standrad JavaScript structure? is it even necessary? >
* <todo: others?, >
* <todo: better comprehensive view of necessary non functionals, >

DONE
