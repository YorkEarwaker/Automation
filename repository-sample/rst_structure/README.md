# Rust

Rust project directory and file organisation.

## Notes

### Use Cases - confirm use cases as below

Consider as first class before C/C++/ASM only where there is an use case to do so. 
* -, Steep learning curve, 
* -, Maintainability with multicode projects
* +, DARPA converting all C code to Rust, 
* +, Many successful projects, 

Pluses - good for use case
* performance critical systems
* security sensitive applications
* long running services
* CLI tools - mature ecosystem for system programming and cli

Minuses - bad for use case
* Rapid prototying
* Tight deadlines
* Extensive legacy code bases
* GUI & AI/ML no tools - no mature ecosystem for GUI and AI/ML

## Status

TODO
* <todo: iterate Rust Project repository structure, dirs, files, work in progress wip >
* <todo: consider, two dir structures, one for Cargo, one for generic cross language consistency, >
* <todo: consider, Would it be possible for Rust source code crates to match packages in C/Cpp & Java & Python like; e.g. /src/com-net-org/project-name/module-name/sub-module-name, >
* ...

DONE
* <done: intent to commit, >
